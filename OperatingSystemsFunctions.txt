Managing programs is one function of an operating system. This allows the user to multi-task and use more than one program at a time. This is a very important function because you want your operating system to be able to manage as many programs as needed.
Managing memory is another function of an operating system. Each program gets a certain amount of memory. The operating system will start storing copies of the pages into files in the hard disk if the memory becomes full.
